    "Who are your target users?\n",

    "- Netflix users range from much different age ranges globally. The interesting aspect with Netflix is its recommendation system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix generates movies, television shows, and documentaries bases off what is popular on social media, for instance, Facebook has a column in Netflix dedicated to what the users likes on Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting fact is Netflix goes based off where the users reside. An example would be users from the United States see suggestions for horror, action, and comedy flicks based off what the users in North American liked to watch. Therefore, to sum up who the target users are, it concludes that many of the users are from all age ranges and all walks of life.\n",

    "\n",
    "What are their key goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key goal is for Netflix to continue to provide the users with the most relevant options which are popular throughout the world, and for Netflix to have their user subscribe monthly and counties to keep the recommendations flowing to keep their business active globally. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you help them accomplish those goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a user “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” a show or movies it helps Netflix reach their goal of broadening the users’ recommendation selection, and generates additional selections for the featured shows and movies or their choice. By “thumbing now”, the Netflix system will exclude those movies and shows you dislike.\n"
